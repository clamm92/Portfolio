                Outside of academic and career-focused work such as building projects and
                practicing data structures and algorithms through platforms like NeetCode,
                I place strong emphasis on maintaining a healthy and balanced lifestyle.
                I value discipline, consistency, and intentional use of time both
                professionally and personally.

                One of my core passions is weightlifting. Ever since reaching my high school
                leaderboard for squats and cleans, lifting has been a constant in my life.
                I train at least five times a week on a structured split, focusing on
                progressive overload and long-term consistency. The gym is a space where I
                feel grounded and focused and reinforces discipline, self-improvement, and
                steady progress.

            <p className="mb-3">
                Chess is the primary game I play and a favorite way to unwind. I enjoy the
                strategy and competitive nature of the game, and I'm currently 
                rated approximately 1700 in rapid and bullet and 1650 in blitz,
                placing me in the top few percent on Chess.com. Chess helps me reset
                mentally while still engaging analytical and strategic thinking.

            <p className="mb-3">
                I have been involved in basketball since childhood both as a player and a
                fan (go Blazers!). I enjoy the competitive and collaborative aspects of team sports and
                the strategic dynamics of the game. I currently play intramural basketball
                at the University of Washington, and occasionally watch NBA games.
            </p>

            <p className="mb-3">
                Spending time outdoors is an important part of my routine. I enjoy long
                walks throughout the Pacific Northwest, especially in Seattle parks like
                Volunteer Park, Madrona Park, and Alki Beach, and when visiting my hometown 
                Portland, Mount Tabor Park and the numerous hikes along the Columbia Gorge. 
                Being in nature helps clear my mind, practice mindfulness, and feel 
                more connected to my surroundings.
            </p>

            <p className="mb-3">
                Although I no longer play the viola or piano regularly, classical music
                remains a strong interest of mine. I enjoy attending University of
                Washington School of Music events, particularly the seasonal UW Symphony
                Orchestra concerts. The ambience and live performances provide a calm and
                meaningful counterbalance to my technical work.
