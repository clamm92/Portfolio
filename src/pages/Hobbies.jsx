                One of my core passions is weightlifting. Ever since reaching my high school
                leaderboard for squats and cleans, lifting has been a constant in my life.
                I train at least five times a week on a structured split, focusing on
                progressive overload and long-term consistency. The gym is a space where I
                feel grounded and focused and reinforces discipline, self-improvement, and
                steady progress.
